    "\n",
    "## Maximum Number of Words Fit\n",
    "1. For each word in the dictionary \n",
    "2. Find the word in the board\n",
    "3. Store the coordinates of the word as new board, where 1 stands for matched cells, whereas 0 (zero) for unused cell\n",
    "4. For each pair of words add the matrices\n",
    "5. Are all resulting cells are either 1 or zero?\n",
    "5.1 yes, then create a tuple-dictionary with the names of two words, e.g., {rat, eat}.\n",
    "5.2 no, then do nothing\n",
    "6. Use these dictionaries to generate all possible linked lists\n",
    "7. Sort them by length, return the largest one.\n",
    "## Maximum total length of Words fit\n",
    "Similar to approach for 2.1, except that sort the linked lists by size of the words, that would require considering only one word from each tuple-dictionary."
