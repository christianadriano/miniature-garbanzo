    "1. Each entry in the dictionary appears only once in the board\n",
    "2. Best fit can be w.r.t.:\n",
    "2.1 maximum number of words\n",
    "2.2 total length of words (or minimum number of unused cells in the board)\n",
    "3. Best performance w.r.t. number of steps necessary to fill in the optimal board\n",
    "\n",
    "I will discuss solutions for 2.1 and 2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximum Number of Words Fit (brute force)\n",
    "1. For each word in the dictionary \n",
    "2. Find the word in the board (involves looking for the first letter and going around)\n",
    "    1. For each match in the board for the same word\n",
    "    2. Create a matrix, that stores the coordinates that matched the word. To represent a match, uses 1 for matched cells, otherwise write zero in the matrix (very sparse matrix)\n",
    "    3. Give this matrix a key identifier, e.g., word_v1, word_v2, etc\n",
    "4. For each pair of words add the matrices\n",
    "5. Are all resulting cells are either one or zero?\n",
    "    1. yes, then create a tuple-dictionary with the names of two words, e.g., {rat, eat}.\n",
    "    2. no, then do nothing\n",
    "6. Use these dictionaries to generate all possible linked lists\n",
    "7. Sort them by length, return the largest one.\n",
    "## Maximum total length of Words fit\n",
    "Similar to approach for 2.1, except that sort the linked lists by size of the words, that would require considering only one word from each tuple-dictionary."

    "## Improvement in Perfomance\n",
    "Here I try to minimize the number of steps of the previous algorithm. My strategy consists:\n",
    "1. Sort the words in the dictionary, so I go from larger to smaller. The insight here is that larger words will show more quickly that certain combinations of words are impossible to fit in the board.\n",
    "2. Create a binary tree where each level corresponds to word. The left edge means that the word is included in the board, whereas the right edge means that the word is not included.\n",
    "2.1 Start with the largest word and find a match\n",
    "2.1.1 If match found, generate the next two nodes in the tree. Each new child node corresponds to a board in which the word was fit (left) or not (right). This means that the left nodes are just copies of the parent node\n",
    "2.1.2 If match not found, just copy the parent node board to the left node.\n",
    "3. **Depth First Search** (DFS) Build this tree doing a DFS from left to right and keep track of the best result (both w.r.t. number of words and total length)\n",
    "4. **Pruning** Before opening a new child node, check if it is still possible to obtain better results than the best one, given the remaining number of words and their lengths that can be obtained.\n",
